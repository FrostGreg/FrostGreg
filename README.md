## <img src="assets/eyes.gif" width="5%"> - About me

When I'm not coding, i'm probably chilling with my headphones on, sporting everything from Tyler the Creator to Fleetwood Mac üéß and currently trying to build up my vinyl collection. I've recently fallen down the rabbit hole of watches, with a simple collection of a Casioak and an Orient Bambino ‚è±Ô∏è. On top of that, I'm often playing video games, The Witcher 3 has its hooks in me as it's the one game I keep going back to ‚öîÔ∏è. So, whether I'm coding, spinning a record, tinkering with timepieces, or immersed in a video game, i'm often doing it with a relaxed charm üòâ.
