## <img src="assets/eyes.gif" height="20px"> - About me

I'm just your laid-back British tech enthusiast who's got a weird obsession for Lord of the Rings üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. When I'm not coding, i'm probably chilling with my vinyl collection, sporting everything from Tyler the Creator to Fleetwood Mac üéß. Oh, and I've recently fallen down the rabbit hole of watches, with a simple collection of a Casioak and an Orient Bambino ‚è±Ô∏è. On top of that, I'm often playing video games, The Witcher 3 has its hooks in me like no other ‚öîÔ∏è. So, whether I'm hacking code, spinning records, tinkering with timepieces, or roaming virtual worlds, i'm often doing it with a relaxed charm üòâ.

If you're feeling awesome today and want to spread some good vibes. It's like giving a virtual high-five to support what I do. No pressure at all, but if you're up for it, you'll have my eternal gratitude!
